# advent-clj

A repository for holding the answers to the Advent of Code challenges, solved in Clojure.

In the past, I would create a new repo every year whenever Advent of Code started.
With this repo, I'm starting over from the beginning (2015) and working through every problem in Clojure
for practice, and to scratch the coding itch (I'm a manager now ðŸ˜©)
